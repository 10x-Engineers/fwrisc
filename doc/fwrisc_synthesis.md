# FWRISC Synthesis

FWRISC has a goal of supporting the majority of available FPGA platforms. Currently, FWRISC
has a complete synthesis flow setup for Microsemi FPGAs, and runs synthesis for Lattice
using Yosys.

All synthesis-related files are stored in the _synth_ subdirectory of the FWRISC project.
